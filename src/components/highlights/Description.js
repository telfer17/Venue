        <h3>So what is HOLO?</h3>
        <p>The HOLO concept is a culmination of the several years of holographic technology Eric’s been working on during his EPIC shows.  The goal of HOLO was to introduce a tourable holographic live experience that works in more locations than the purpose-built EPIC stages.  It’s an exciting prospect given what Eric’s done with holographic elements to date in his EPIC shows.</p>
